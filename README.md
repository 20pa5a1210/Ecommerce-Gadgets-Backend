# Backend Setup

The backend of the e-commerce application is built using Go, Gin, and MongoDB. Go is a powerful programming language known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it an excellent choice for building robust web applications. Gin is a lightweight web framework for Go that provides a simple and intuitive API for creating RESTful APIs. MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, is used for storing and managing the application's data. With MongoDB, you can benefit from its flexibility and scalability, making it a suitable choice for an e-commerce application that may handle a large volume of data. The backend project is organized into different components, such as routes, controllers, and models, following best practices for structuring a Go web application. By leveraging the power of Go, Gin, and MongoDB, the backend provides a reliable and efficient foundation for the e-commerce application.
